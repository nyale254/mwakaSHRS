            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The Student Health Record System (SHRS) aims to streamline 
                the management of student medical records, appointments, 
                medication, and vaccination data in a secure and efficient manner.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                To enhance healthcare delivery within academic institutions 
                by leveraging modern web technologies for improved accessibility, 
                transparency, and efficiency.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This System?</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional paper-based medical systems are slow, prone to errors, 
                and difficult to manage. SHRS provides a centralized digital solution 
                that enables healthcare providers and students to access records 
                quickly and securely.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to ensure
                performance, security, and scalability.
